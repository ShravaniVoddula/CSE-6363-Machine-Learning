# CSE-6363-Machine-Learning
This repository is implementation of various ML Algorithms using python. Here, in most of the algorithms, I did not use pre-defined fit and predict functions.
I defined my own fit and predict functions so that i learn the basics of the ML algorithm breifly.
I did not focus on accuracy while implementing these ML alogorithms, but instead focused on understanding of Algorithms.
